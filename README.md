# LawEase (Ongoing)

A huge percentage of rural residents in India face a significant, often overlooked challenge: dealing with legal issues in their daily lives, professional spheres, and communities. Often, they lack awareness of the legal solutions available. To address this, we've created a user-friendly platform to help them navigate these complexities.

## Project Overview
LawEase is designed to make legal information and solutions accessible to everyone, especially those in rural areas. Our platform categorizes legal problems into clear sections and subcategories, making information easy to find. We present relevant laws and legal firms in simple language, including regional languages, and provide video summaries for further clarity. Additionally, we connect users with lawyers for personalized advice and recommendations.

## Features
- **Categorized Legal Problems:** Legal issues are organized into clear sections and subcategories for easy navigation.
- **Simple Language:** All information is presented in easy-to-understand language, with support for regional languages.
- **Video Summaries:** Key legal topics and solutions are explained through short, informative videos.
- **Lawyer Connect:** Users can connect with lawyers for personalized advice and recommendations.
- **Legal Firm Listings:** Find and contact legal firms relevant to your needs.

## Tech Stack
